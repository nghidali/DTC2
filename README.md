# DTC2
Using the wonderful WaveHC library by Adafruit. 

Reinitialize all the pin declarations to correspond to the pins on the microcontrollers you are using. 

For our implementation we used an Arduino UNO for our audio and a Teensy for our lights.

Please contact me at natalie@ghidali.com if you would like to implement something similar and I'll be happy to help you out :)s
